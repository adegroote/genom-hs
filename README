GeNoM is a Module Generator for real time software architecture, particularly
for robotics system, developped at LAAS-CNRS (http://www.laas.fr).

It is an attempt (for fun) to parse and generate client to control these modules
in Haskell (and maybe generate client for other languages).

It is mainly a project to train my Haskell so the code may be of poor quality.

Current status :
	- parsing of Genom specification mostly OK, but need to parse C definition
	  (maybe use language-c)

Requierements :
	- ghc
	- parsec >= 2.0
